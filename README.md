## Test galaxy workflows through bioblend

Script to run all workflows mentioned in the configurable .json.
It will import shared workflows ``published=True`` or directly run the users workflows. 
For each run a history is created which is prefixed by ``TEST_RUN_<date>:``.

You have to sure the json has file names identical to those in the data library.

**This is a limited, practically non tested script. Use at your own risk.**
